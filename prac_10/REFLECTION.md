# CP1404 - Practical 10

## Things to awnser:
regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
`
Sadly it did not.
`

Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
`
That it is very important to setup a construct that does not rely on the teacher saying "just find someone". Rather have a predefined team that can work together throughout the class.
`

Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
`
Allow a more creative approach and be more open minded towards self inititive. Programming is not JUST WHAT YOU WANT. Also more points for each practical would be benefitial along side with a constructive feedback.
`


Include proper markdown links to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
`
I was not always able to find a partner, therefore i can not provide those links.
