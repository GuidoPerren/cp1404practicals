# CP1404 - Practical 07

## About the Repo
This Repo is for the class CP1404, and I'm forced to write something in this README.md file.

## Things about me:
- I would rather not do this part
- I like to use Google like a normal human being
- Writing Coding exams on paper is as useful as a bicycle without wheels

```Python
def print_usefulness():
    print("Not usefull")

def get_exam_format(format):
    if format.upper() == "PAPER":
        print_usefulness
    else:
        print("Thank you for consideringa normal solution!")
```

## Some other infos:
- If you see this and think: "ah yes, I think it's not 1980, and I should reconsider my formats", congrats on that
- If this makes you angry because it differs from your standards, reconsider those standards.
- If you still hold onto those standards repeat the step mentioned above until you do.
